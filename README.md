# Getting to know the hardward using C++...

In this repository, I store numerical experiment showing cache and memory hardware effects.

The examples are implemented in C++.

This repository is strongly inspired by:

 * [“Gallery of Processor Cache Effects“, by Igor Ostrovsky](http://igoro.com/archive/gallery-of-processor-cache-effects/)
 * [“Want fast C++? Know your hardware!“, by Timur Doumler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP6NxVxDQIs)

I provide the C++ codes illustrating the concepts, Python script to plot the results, and a Makefile to re-run the example.
